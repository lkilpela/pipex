1. Empty input: 
Test your program with no arguments. It should handle this case gracefully, 
perhaps by printing a usage message.

2. Non-existent files: 
Test your program with file names that do not exist. Your program should handle this case and print an appropriate error message.

Non-readable or non-writable files: Test your program with files that exist but are not readable (for the input file) or not writable (for the output file). Your program should print an appropriate error message.

Non-existent commands: Test your program with command names that do not exist. Your program should print an appropriate error message.

Commands that fail: Test your program with commands that exist but fail when run (for example, a command that always exits with a non-zero status). Your program should handle this case and return an appropriate exit status.

Large files: Test your program with very large input files to ensure it can handle them without running out of memory or taking too long.

Special characters in file names: Test your program with file names that contain spaces, special characters, or characters that need to be escaped in a shell. Your program should handle these file names correctly.

Piping multiple commands: Test your program with more than two commands to ensure it handles multiple pipes correctly.
